# MVP Base Project - Android
A reusable base project implementing model-view-presenter architecture and useful Android libraries, intended to be used as a template for all of my future Android projects.

## Libraries
 
Libraries used:

- [Android Support library](http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/index.html) (RecyclerView etc.)
- [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) (JVM reactive extensions)
- [RxAndroid](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid) (RxJava Android bindings)
- [Butterknife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife) (field and method binding)
- [Icepick](https://github.com/frankiesardo/icepick) (saving/restoring instance state)
- [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit) (API consumption)
- [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp) (HTTP client)
- [Dagger 2](http://google.github.io/dagger) (dependency injection)
- [Robolectric](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric) (unit testing)
- [Mockito](http://mockito.org/) (unit test mocking)
- [Espresso](https://google.github.io/android-testing-support-library/docs/espresso/index.html) (UI testing)
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) (image loading)
- [MaterialShowcaseView](https://github.com/deano2390/MaterialShowcaseView) (onboarding)

## Usage

### Folder Structure

The folder structure used in this app is based on the [Ribot app](https://github.com/ribot/ribot-app-android) structure.
The app has the following structure:

- **data** - represents the entire data layer.
Includes the following packages (and single files e.g. to handle bus events):
  -  **entities** - all domain-specific java objects. E.g. objects serialized via Retrofit.
  -  **local** - helper classes for interacting with local storage. E.g. DatabaseService, PreferencesService.
  -  **server** - helper classes for interacting with remote API's. E.g. Retrofit, Parse.
  -  **repositories** - domain-specific data managers containing RxJava operators
  to interact with classes in 'local' and 'server'. Example method: getUserByName().
  Each method is typically structured as an interface and implementation.
- **injection** - dependency injection using [Dagger](http://google.github.io/dagger)
modules/components.
- **service** - a class for each of the background services, e.g. beacons, notifications.
- **ui** - the presentation layer. Each folder represents an MVP candidate -
a screen in the app represented by a fragment/activity (the view), a view interface and a presenter.
  -  **base** - a set of base classes from which MVP candidates can inherit.
  -  **main** - a set of main/launcher activities/fragments (e.g. tabbed layout).
  Typically use one per app and delete the others.
  -  **mvpcandidate1** - E.g. sign in screen.
  -  **mvpcandidate2** - E.g. email inbox
  -  etc...
- **ui** - any util classes, e.g. for handling dates, strings, dialogs.
